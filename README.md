# Java_mini_projects

This repository contains five beginner-to-intermediate level Java programs created using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. These projects were developed purely for learning purposes to explore core Java concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.

List of Projects:
1. Training Booking System
A simple console-based system to simulate course booking. It manages seat availability for a training session and allows basic interaction like booking and checking remaining seats.

2. Swiggy Delivery App
A lightweight simulation of a food delivery system where users can view restaurant and order details. It demonstrates class composition and object interaction.

3. Snakes and Ladders Game
A one-player version of the classic board game. It uses random dice rolls and basic game logic with snakes and ladders. The player moves across the board until they reach the end.

4. Tic Tac Toe Game
A console-based 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns. It uses a 2D array to represent the board and switches turns between players. Basic game logic is applied to demonstrate input handling and game state management.

5. Rock Paper Scissors Game
A fun, simple game where two players (one can be the computer) make random choices and the program decides the winner based on standard rules.
